# Data Crawling part

The first branch of code is using recursion of Beautifulsoup. Working well since, however couldn't deal with non-ASCII code names (no idea why it's happening, for they are not supposed to appear in the url). Working on it, and soon would release new version.

However, lots of data has been crawled using this way.

See example for details. It's could be easy orgnizing a graph using [key word detection] in explanation matching with file names.
